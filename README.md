## Guide for accessing files in the Hardware folder and Software folder

**Hardware** : inside this folder, there are two types of files (_.json_ and _.f3d_)
	<br/>
   - The _.json_ files are related to the PCB and system schematics. To view these documents, use the EasyEDA software:
	 At the editor, click **FILE** > **Open** > **EasyEDA**>....> **Hardware** > choose the file you wish to view (_.jason_)
  
  - The _.f3d_ files are 3D models of the silicon mould and the cube skeleton. To view these documents, use the **Fusion 360** software. 
	 Once the software is installed and set up, click the file you wish to view (_.f3d_), and it will automatically open using the **Fusion 360** software.

<br/>

**Software** : inside this folder, the testing code for the components and the COMPLETE Program for the game are available.
<br/>

- To view these codes you can either install C++ compatible IDE(eg. _Arduino IDE, visual studio_) or open with _Notepad_.
